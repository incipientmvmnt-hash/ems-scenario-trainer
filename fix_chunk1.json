Air becomes trapped during exhalation, creating the characteristic musical sound. Common in asthma and bronchiolitis. | Hoarse or muffled voice: Voice changes indicate involvement of the larynx or supraglottic structures — upper airway anatomy. | Prolonged expiratory phase: Prolonged expiration indicates air trapping from lower airway obstruction. The patient must actively exhale to push air past narrowed bronchioles. | Drooling with inability to swallow: Drooling and dysphagia indicate supraglottic swelling (as in epiglottitis or peritonsillar abscess) — upper airway emergencies that may progress to complete obstruction.",

Up to 500 mL of blood loss is considered physiologically normal for vaginal delivery, though prompt management begins well before that threshold. | Continuous bright red vaginal bleeding soaking more than one pad per minute after placental delivery: This rate of bleeding suggests postpartum hemorrhage, most commonly from uterine atony. Immediate fundal massage, keep the uterus firm, and rapid transport. This is a life-threatening emergency. | Mild uterine cramping after delivery with a firm uterine fundus palpable at the umbilicus: Cramping after delivery indicates uterine involution (contraction). A firm fundus at the level of the umbilicus is the expected normal finding and indicates the uterus is contracting to control bleeding. | Newborn with acrocyanosis (blue hands and feet) but pink trunk, strong cry, and HR above 100: Acrocyanosis (blue extremities) is normal in the first 24–48 hours. A pink trunk, strong cry, and heart rate >100 bpm indicate a vigorous, well-transitioning newborn. Central cyanosis would be abnormal. | Placenta has not delivered after 30 minutes, with increasing vaginal bleeding: A retained placenta beyond 30 minutes with increasing bleeding is an emergency. Do NOT pull on the cord — this can cause uterine inversion or cord avulsion. Transport immediately for manual extraction. | Newborn with central cyanosis, gasping respirations, and HR below 60 at 5 minutes of age: This newborn is critically ill. Central cyanosis, gasping, and HR <60 at 5 minutes despite PPV indicates the need for chest compressions (3:1 ratio with ventilations) and emergency transport.",

      "explanation": "Step 1: Hypothermia prevention is critical. Newborns lose heat rapidly. Place on a warm, dry surface. In the prehospital setting, skin-to-skin contact with the mother and covering both is effective when a warmer is unavailable. | Step 2: Vigorous drying provides thermal management and tactile stimulation simultaneously. Remove wet towels and replace with dry ones. Brief stimulation (back rub, sole flicks) may initiate breathing. | Step 3: Place the head in a neutral position (slight extension). Routine suctioning is no longer recommended — suction only if visible secretions are obstructing the airway. | Step 4: After the initial steps (within 30-60 seconds), if the newborn remains apneic or has a heart rate below 100 bpm, PPV with room air or blended oxygen is initiated. PPV is the most critical intervention. | Step 5: PPV is delivered at 40-60 breaths per minute with just enough pressure to see gentle chest rise. Use a neonatal-sized mask ensuring a good seal over the mouth and nose.",
